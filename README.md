I’ve worked with several AWS services to host, deploy, and scale full-stack applications:

| **EC2** | Hosting Laravel, Node.js, and MERN apps in production environments |
| **S3** | File storage for static assets, images, and backups |
| **RDS** | Managed MySQL/PostgreSQL databases |
| **CloudFront** | CDN for faster content delivery |

| **IAM** | Secure user and role-based access management |

💡 I regularly deploy Node.js and Laravel applications on AWS EC2 with **PM2 process management** and **Nginx reverse proxy**, integrating S3 for media storage and CloudFront for global performance.
